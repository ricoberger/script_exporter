## Specify security settings for the created Pods. To set the security settings for the script_exporter Container use
## the corresponding "securityContext" field.
## See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod
##

## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious choice for the user. This
## also increases chances charts run on environments with little resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to
## specify resources, uncomment the following lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after
## 'resources:'.
